This is my CodeLouisville graduation project. The goal was to design a responsive website, using the knowledge gained in the front end development course. I picked up a non-profit organization in Louisville "La Casita Center" that does not have a responsive website and attempted to redesign it.

The new website was created, using mobile 1-st approach. Responsiveness was accomplished by implementing media queries at the certain breakpoints.
I did not use any plug-ins or frameworks that help you build a website.  I used my knowledge gained from treehouse courses and created the website with just HTML5, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, and jQuery.

Also, I added several new things:

1.	Made a favorite icon. Now you can see this little picture along with the organization name in browser tabs.

2.	Created a sticky navigation with just a few lines of CSS and JavaScript. Navigation becomes sticky only after a certain point scrolling down the page.

3.	On larger screens, navigation is horizontal. Drop-down menu appears when the parent element is hovered over. For visitors using smaller screens, a menu button with a hamburger icon is displayed. When it is clicked or touched, it will show all menu items vertically, including drop-down menu items. It was achieved with the jQuery slideToggle() method. Dropdown menu was created, using css only.

4.	Implemented search function. Now, it is possible to search the entire website for a specific content.

5.	Added bilingual functionality. The site will have a Spanish version with the exact same design.

6.	Another thing I would like to bring your attention to is the “donate” button that I created. It looks different from the other tabs in the navigation - it has a shape of a ribbon that makes it standout and immediately draw a user’s attention.  It will be have the same location on every page.  This will help ensure whenever visitors feel compelled to donate, they will know exactly where to click. The ribbon was created with css.

7.	Added another call to action: “You Can Make a Difference, Too” which takes users to the volunteer page.

8.	Image carousel was created with just a few lines of jQuery. It’s responsive and I did not use any plug-ins.

9.	The website footer now contains quick links and short description of the organization, along with important contact information.

Right now all other pages except the home page are linked to their existing pages. If La Casita Center approves my design and chooses to publish it, I will finish creating the rest of the pages. Each page will have the exact same design, incl. footer, just content will differ.
